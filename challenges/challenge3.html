        <h2>The Power of Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>
            Renewable energy, derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly, includes sources like
            sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Embracing renewable energy is crucial for reducing
            carbon emissions, combating climate change, and decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels.
